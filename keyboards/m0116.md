# Apple M0116

This is a really nice example of the Apple M0116. Also known as the Apple
Standard Keyboard. Sold with the Macintosh II and SE from late 1980s to early
1990s. This was the considered to be the basic keyboard to use with these
systems with users being able to buy the M0115 (Apple Extended Keyboard) if they
wanted something with more keys. The M0115 is closer to modern layouts.

This keyboard uses ALPS Orange tactile switches. I haven't yet found a modern
tactile switch that comes close to the ALPS offerings. The switches in this one
are in really nice condition, and therefore I haven't felt the need to do much
with it in terms of restoration. I use this with 
[Kuritakey's](https://kuritakey.zone) ADB to USB converter. This is definitely
one of my most used boards.
